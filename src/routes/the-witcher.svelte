    <h2>The Witcher</h2>

    <p>
    <em>Description:</em> “Geralt of Rivia, a mutated monster-hunter for hire, journeys
    toward his destiny in a turbulent world where people often prove more wicked
     than beasts.”
    </p>

    <p>Rotten Tomatoes critic score: 67%</p>

    What critics said: “And although The Witcher is more fantasy
    balderdash, it’s also somewhat addictive fantasy balderdash. 
    Bring on the blood-spilling, the orgies, the haunted forests and
    wizards: It seems we can’t get enough.” – Detroit News
